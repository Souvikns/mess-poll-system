# Contributing Guidelines üëºüèΩ üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª üëáüèΩ

We are extremely excited to have you onboard with our project. We hope to see some great contributions from your end and thank you all for making this project successful. ü§ó

Before getting down to business, we believe to keep ourselves updated with the basics and so here are few extremely useful resources to get started with learning how to make contribution. Feel free to explore them :

- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** : is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
- **[Github Guides](https://guides.github.com)** : Learn all about Github Flow, Git Commits, Making Pull Request, Forking Projects and more.

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

1. Reporting a bug
2. Discussing the current state of the code
3. Submitting a fix
4. Proposing new features
5. Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

  We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.


## Pull Requests 
1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build. 
2. Update the [README.md](https://github.com/cu-unofficial/mess-poll-system/blob/master/README.md) with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. We strictly use GitFlow and try to have a linear merge. Please follow the guidelines below.


## GitFlow 

1. Navigate to the [CatsInTech/Rezume](https://github.com/CatsInTech/Rezume/tree/master) repository and click on Fork button.
2. You'll either find a way to fork to your own account or you will have a link to go to your forked repository. Clicking on either takes you to the forked repository.
3. You can confirm that this repository is a fork of the original repository by finding the "forked from [CatsInTech/Rezume](https://github.com/CatsInTech/Rezume)" text under the repository name.
4. Click on the clone or download button on the forked repository. Make sure you are cloning your version. 
5. Proceed with any changes that you want make to the codebase as you feel. 
6. Comit those changes that you have made. 
7. Make a pull request.
